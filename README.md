# SimpleDDFD
This repository contains the source code for our simplified DDFD model based on the architecture described in [Multi-view Face Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02766#) by Sachin Sudhakar Farfade, Mohammad Saberian, Li-Jia Li

We included our trained model weights in this repository to make testing and evaluating easier. 

The code was developed on Google Colab using an NVIDIA A100 GPU. 


> This source code was developed for the final project for CS 163 Fall 2024
